CUNY Spitzer School of Architecture - 2021

Repository to place all CityEngine code for Unit26 for the Spitzer School of Architecture. A syllabus for the class that created this repository *[click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OeA53enEJdavxhBFRCKM4Jie3uw_BkkP8MtLnRKEhug/edit?usp=sharing)*



## Intro
This repository is a collaboration of different teams assembled in **Unit26’s Design Anarchy Studio**. The repository contains the code for each individual system created by the groups of students of 2021. These systems are the result of viewing the city as a series of self-assembled systems that interact and integrate with one another. The following systems were identified:

1. Waste and Density
2. Events and Community(Balance Spaces)
3. Telecommunications
4. Surfacescapes (“Streets”)
5. Economic Activity (“Commercial”)
6. Urban Ecology

## About the repository’s use

The repository is meant to be use in coordination with *[CityEngine 2021.1](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/whats-new/cityengine-whats-new.htm)*. 

For optimal use, you should copy the repositoy to the *Default Workspace* that CityEngine generates on your desktop. These rules can be used with any dataset, but some of them work specifically with attributes generated in a GIS environment.

You can download the sample data the class used to develop the system rules [as a geodatabase here](https://ccny.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4c42640d19f44663b3bbdefa599d31e5#overview) and a [hosted service here](https://services3.arcgis.com/sJvdLIgPMD7cWjlL/arcgis/rest/services/TheSite/FeatureServer).
