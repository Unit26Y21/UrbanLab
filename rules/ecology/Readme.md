The Ecology team sought to reimaginine impervious city surfaces to be performative through augmented ecology for efficient rain/storm-water management, heat mitigation, reduced energy consumption, ecosystem biodiversity and improved human health. To represent this hypothesis in a functioning system, the Ecology team set out to achieve two main tasks through CGA code in City Engine: 

1 - To generate building typologies that maximized performative surface area for water retention.

For this part of the code, buildings were split into floors which were then shifted to ensure surface exposure to rainfall.

2 - To assign various vegetation types to building and ground surfaces that would maximize water retention and ecosystem biodiversity.

This part of the code dealt with the application of an elaborate vegetation catalog, where vegetation types were placed on surfaces based on their unique attributes.
