The Ecology team sought to reimagine city surfaces to be performative through ecology with a specific focus on building typologies. The code produced therefore performed two tasks: 

1 - To generate building typologies that maximized performative surface area 

For this part of the code, buildings were split into floors which were then shifted to ensure surface exposure to rainfall; which maximized water retention. 



2 - To assign various vegetation types to building and ground surfaces that would maximize water retention
