The Ecology team sought to reimagine impervious city surfaces to be performative through augmented ecology for efficient rain/storm-water management, heat mitigation, reduced energy consumption, ecosystem biodiversity and improved human health. The code produced comprised of two main tasks: 

1 - To generate building typologies that maximized performative surface area for water retention
For this part of the code, buildings were split into floors which were then shifted to ensure surface exposure to rainfall.

2 - To assign various vegetation types to building and ground surfaces that would maximize water retention and ecosystem biodiversity.
This part of the code dealt with the application of an elaborate vegetation catalog, where vegetation types were placed on surfaces based on their unique attributes.
