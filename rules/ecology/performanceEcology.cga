#{attr, const} when you have a value that can change or not.
# attr: box called HorizontalSurfaceType and I want to store this values in this parameter
# const: this box is static and can only hold one value
# example const FAR = 1 . Inside rule you try to set FAR to 3, CE wont allowed because its a const.

#mechanism to perform repeated instructions.
#functionName(input1, input2, input3) = 
	#option1 x*y
	#option2 if else is case else
	
# the rule is the machine that intervenes in the digital space
